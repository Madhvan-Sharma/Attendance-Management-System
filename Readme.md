# ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Our project, “​Attendance Management System​” is a program which deals with the maintenance of student’s attendance details.

It allows teachers to mark their student’s attendance. It is maintaining a daily basis of attendance. 

In our program, Admin will be provided with the separate ​Username ​and ​Password ​to maintain student’s attendance. The Teacher(s) handling the particular subject(s) are responsible for taking attendance of each student present in that class. Students are marked present only if they are present on that particular date . 

The percentage (%) attendance of students will be calculated daily.

This project is modelled on the Attendance Management System of ​Delhi Technological University and we hope to replicate the same by being more efficient.
